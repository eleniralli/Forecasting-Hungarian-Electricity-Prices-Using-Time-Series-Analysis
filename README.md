Time Series Analysis: Proficient in decomposing time series data into trend, seasonal, and random components.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Experience in handling missing data, linear interpolation, and data normalization (deflation).

Statistical Modeling: Applied ARIMA, SARIMA, and other time series models for forecasting.

Model Evaluation: Conducted model diagnostics using AIC/BIC criteria, residual analysis, and various error metrics (RMSE, MAE).

Forecasting: Developed and validated predictive models to forecast future electricity prices.

R Programming: Utilized R for data analysis, including the use of libraries such as forecast, ggplot2, and dplyr for statistical analysis and visualization.

Cross-Validation: Implemented rolling forecast cross-validation to assess the accuracy of predictive models.
